Smalltalk-78
============
Smalltalk-78 is a variant of Smalltalk-76 stripped down to work on the portable "NoteTaker" machine.
In this repository is a Virtual Machine written in JavaScript to run a Smalltalk-78 snapshot in the web browser.

To learn more, please read our paper [Reviving Smalltalk-78: The First Modern Smalltalk Lives Again][paper].

The [index.html][standalone] in this directory should give you a running version for testing, although the browser integration is incomplete (e.g. copy/paste or file management). The full environment is on the [Lively Smalltalk-78][lively] page which also has a graphical VM debugger,
You may also try Alan Borning's [Thinglab][thinglab] which runs on this VM.
